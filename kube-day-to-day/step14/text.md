# Secret as volume mount and environment variable

You need to make changes on an existing Pod in Namespace moon called `secret-handler`. Create a new Secret `secret1` which contains `user=test` and `pass=pwd`. The Secret's content should be available in Pod `secret-handler` as environment variables `SECRET1_USER` and `SECRET1_PASS`. The yaml for Pod secret-handler is available at `/opt/course/14/secret-handler.yaml`.

There is existing yaml for another Secret at `/opt/course/14/secret2.yaml`, create this Secret and mount it inside the same Pod at /tmp/secret2. Your changes should be saved under /opt/course/14/secret-handler-new.yaml. Both Secrets should only be available in Namespace moon.
