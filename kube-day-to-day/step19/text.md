# Node Port

In Namespace jupiter you'll find an apache Deployment (with one replica) named jupiter-crew-deploy and a ClusterIP Service called jupiter-crew-svc which exposes it. Change this service to a NodePort one to make it available on all nodes on port 30100.

Test the NodePort Service using the internal IP of all available nodes and the port 30100 using curl, you can reach the internal node IPs directly from your main terminal. On which nodes is the Service reachable? On which node is the Pod running?
